 *	Solves the knight probability problem
 *
 *	PROBLEM STATEMENT:
 *	1] A knight starts at a fixed position (x,y) in mxm chessboard
 *	2] Knight moves around n-times.
 *	3] Each move is equally distributed, i.e. if there are 8 squares the knight can move to, each square has probability 1/8
 *	4] Find the probability distribution on the chessboard of the knight's location after n-moves
